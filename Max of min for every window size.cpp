/*Use a monotonic stack to compute for each index i the previous smaller and next smaller positions in one pass. From those you get the maximum window length where arr[i] is the minimum.
For each index i we record arr[i] as a candidate for window size window[i].
Finally we ensure ans is monotonic (non-increasing) by pushing each value leftwards so every smaller window gets at least the value of larger windows if applicable.
